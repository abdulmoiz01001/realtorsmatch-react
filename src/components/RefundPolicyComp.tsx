      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>For Failure to Provide Leads:</strong> Agents must send a <em>written reminder</em>. If no leads are delivered within <strong>1 month</strong>, they may request a refund.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>For Other Cases:</strong> Agents must notify <strong>Realtors Match</strong> with <em>supporting evidence</em>. If a replacement isnâ€™t provided within <strong>1 month</strong>, they may request a refund.
